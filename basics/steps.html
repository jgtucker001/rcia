                            as the candidates express and the Church accepts their intention to respond to God's call to follow the way

                        <p>The Period of Purification and Enlightenment corresponds to that time known in the Roman Catholic Church as Lent and 
                            has the character of a time of retreat for the elect who are preparing for Baptism, for the candidates who will complete 
                            their initiation or enter the full communion of the Catholic Church, and for the faithful who will commemorate their 
                            own Baptism at Easter.</p>
                            <p>The centerpiece of this period of prayerful preparation is the celebration of the <b>Scrutinies</b>. Although the candidates 
                                will not be the subject of the Scrutinies, catechesis for both the elect and the candidates during this period is 
                                related to the celebration of the Scrutinies.</p>
                            <p>The Scrutinies are celebrated on the third, fourth, and fifth Sundays of the Lenten season. At the Masses at which 
                                the Scrutinies are celebrated, the cycle A readings must be used (RCIA no.146).</p>

                            through Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist. (RCIA Part 1)</p>
                            <p>Reception of baptized Christians (candidates) into the full communion of the Catholic Church can be integrated into

                            Sunday and completes the initiation process. Those who have just shared in the sacraments of initiation are now called 
                            Neophytes and during this period of Easter joy they reflect on what they have just gone through and look to the future 
                            as to how they can now share in the mission of Christ who came to bring salvation and life to the whole world. The Bishop 
                            gathers with the neophytes for a Eucharistic celebration during the Easter season.</p>
